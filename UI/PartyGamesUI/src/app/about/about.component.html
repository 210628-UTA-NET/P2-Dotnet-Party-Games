              Dotnet Party Games is a multiplayer mini-game roulette- a web-based application that will allow users to compete with each other in a series of simple browser games. You can make an account and queue into live matchmaking allowing users to actively compete with each other through a variety of different web games. Here, game stats can be tracked and provided within a userâ€™s profile and a global leaderboard can be established. After a game session, users will have the option to rematch or requeue into matchmaking, where the process will be repeated. Relevant game statistics will be recorded and available for access within a user profile (wins/losses/personal best(PB)/performance).
